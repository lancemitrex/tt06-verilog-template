# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  how_it_works: |
      The project was originated during the training class, "ChipCraft: The Art of Chip Design for Non-Experts" presented by eFabless.

The project utilizes techniques associated with Tiny Tapeout and Redwood EDA.

Project Title: Input DIP Switch to HEX 7-Segment Display.

This Project is a 'simple' project for inexperienced FPGA and/or inexperienced Verilog programmers. The project reads the INPUT DIP Switch on the Tiny Tapeout Demo Board and outputs the properly formatted Hex character, to the 7-Segment display which is also located on the Tiny Tapeout Demo Board.

The complete Transaction-Level Verilog code is located in the file, "DIPSwitch_7-segment.v"

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Select a Digit : 1-16, using binary, and set the DIP Switch to the appropriate binary value.  
      The 7-Segment Display will display the HEX value for the binary Input.

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
  inputs:               
    - DIP Switch: BINARY Value.
# A description of what the outputs do (e.g. status LED, SPI MISO, etc)
  outputs:
    The 7-segment display segments will be 'lit' up according to the Binary Input value.
    - segment a
    - segment b
    - segment c
    - segment d
    - segment e
    - segment f
    - segment g
    - dot
# A description of what the bidirectional I/O pins do (e.g. I2C SDA, I2C SCL, etc)
  bidirectional:
    - none
   

# The following fields are optional
 
# Do not change!
